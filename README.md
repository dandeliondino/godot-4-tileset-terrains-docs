## Creating terrain sets (autotiling) documentation

This repo contains a PDF and resources from an archived PR that updated the **Using TileSets: Creating terrain sets (autotiling)** documentation for Godot 4. It is available here as a resource to help new users set up terrain tiles.

### Outline
- Creating terrain sets (autotiling)
    - Understanding how terrains work
    - Choosing a terrain mode
        - Match Sides
        - Match Corners
        - Match Corners and Sides
    - Setting up a new terrain set
        - Setting up terrain tiles in Paint mode
        - Setting up terrain tiles in Select mode
    - Special cases
        - Animating terrain tiles
        - Using probabilities for multiple tiles with the same bitmask
        - Using alternative tiles for one tile with multiple bitmasks

### Why this is here

In 2023, I responded to a request to update the Godot 4 docs section for [Using TileSets: Creating terrain sets (autotiling)](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/2d/using_tilesets.html#creating-terrain-sets-autotiling). While I received feedback that [the PR I created](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7789) had been submitted correctly, there seemed to be no interest in reviewing or merging it. I ended up closing the PR as it was blocking others from updating those docs with edits that might be more likely to get merged.

I understand this is how things go in open-source development, and my interpretation of the documentation might not have fit the goals the core team had for these docs. I have tremendous respect for all the maintainers of the Godot docs -- they've done an amazing job in establishing a standard of highly accessible documentation.

For a time, Godot users could still access the content in this original PR on Github as a reference. However, Github seems to have changed how the Sphinx (rst) file previews are displayed, so the images are no longer inline. The images are particularly important for understanding these docs.

As of 5/2024, the official docs have yet to be updated, and I still see almost-daily requests on social media for explanations of Godot 4's terrain sets (particularly what the center bits are for!). So I decided to repost the docs here as a pdf. They are not as accessible as the original format, but I hope this will still be useful.

This documentation was created in Godot 4.0/4.1. There have been changes to the UI since then, but the instructions in this PR should be the same for 4.2/4.3.

I welcome anyone who wants to use any of the content from my original PR ([#7789]((https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7789)) to create a new PR for the terrain sets section. See the [commit](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7789/files#diff-f1afad32ca03f3a25b1c50f47996f838c74c9f94ead387382f21b9ef02d53a72) for the original `rst` file and `webp` images.

In 2023, I responded to a request to update the Godot 4 docs section for [Using TileSets: Creating terrain sets (autotiling)](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/2d/using_tilesets.html#creating-terrain-sets-autotiling). While I received feedback that [the PR I created](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7789) had been submitted correctly, there was no subsequent interest in reviewing or merging it. I ended up closing the PR as it seemed to be blocking others from updating those docs with a PR that would be more likely to get merged.

I understand this is how things go in open-source development, and I have tremendous respect for the maintainers of the Godot docs -- they've done an amazing job in establishing a standard of highly accessible documentation.

For a time, new Godot users could still access the content in this original PR on Github as a reference. However, Github seems to have changed how the Sphinx (rst) file previews are displayed, so the formatting is lost and the images are no longer inline. The images are particularly important for reading these docs.

As of 5/2024, the official docs have yet to be updated, and I still see almost-daily requests on social media for explanations of Godot 4's terrain sets (particularly what the center bits are for!). So I decided to repost the docs here as a pdf. They are not as accessible as the original format, but I hope this will still be useful.
